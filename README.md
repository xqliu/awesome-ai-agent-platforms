# Awesome AI Agent Platforms [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of open-source AI agent platforms: AI coworkers and teammates, agent builders and frameworks, workflow automation platforms, browser agents, and coding agents, with license and hosting notes for every entry.

AI coworkers are persistent agents that people delegate real work to: they sign in to tools, keep context, run on schedules, and come back with finished work. This list covers the platforms that provide them, the frameworks developers build them with, and the automation and specialist agents around them.

## Selection criteria

An entry must:

- Have an active official repository or product page that clearly explains what it does.
- Offer a usable product, framework, or runtime. Demo-only repositories and resource lists do not qualify.
- State enough public information to verify its license and hosting model.
- Be maintained. Discontinued projects and repositories that point new users to a successor do not qualify.

Each project appears once, under the category that best matches its main use. License and hosting notes reflect the linked repository at the time of the last verification. Inclusion is not an endorsement, and star counts, funding, and company size are not criteria.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open a pull request that adds or changes one entry at a time:

1. Add the entry to the category that best matches its main use, in alphabetical order.
2. Link to the official repository, or the official product page only when no canonical repository exists.
3. Write one factual sentence about what the tool does. No slogans, star counts, or comparisons.
4. State the current license and hosting model in the same bullet.
5. Confirm the project meets the [selection criteria](#selection-criteria).
